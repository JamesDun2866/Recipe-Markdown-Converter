tags: Dessert


ingredients: 
- 6 green chilli peppers, stalks on 6 red chilli peppers, stalks on

- 350ml  vodka

- 100g  good-quality white chocolate or dark chocolate, minimum 60% cocoa solids to fill the chillies

- black pepper, freshly ground

- 100g  dark chocolate, minimum 60% cocoa solids

- icing sugar

directions: 
- Wash the chillies, then cut a small slit in the side each one to allow you to remove the inner membrane and all the seeds, so they are ready to be filled Marinate the prepared chillies in the vodka for at least 12 hours before you prepare the filling

- To make the filling, melt the white or dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl suspended over a saucepan of barely simmering water. Remove from the heat and mix in a shot of vodka and some freshly ground pepper. Fill the chillies using a piping bag fitted with small nozzle, or, if you don't have one, use a coffee spoon and a chopstick instead. Store the chillies in a container in the freezer until needed.

- Sift icing sugar over a serving plate. Grind some black pepper over the icing sugar.

- To dip the chillies, melt the dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl suspended over a saucepan of barely simmering water. Pour the melted chocolate into a glass and dip the chillies so that they are three quarters coated in chocolate. Place them directly on to the serving plate to set before serving.
